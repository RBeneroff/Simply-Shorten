# Simply-Shorten
Final Small MEAN Stack app

I felt like recreating a URL shortener!

User Story:
As a user, your only purpose to use Simply-Shorten would be to shorten an extremely long URL. If you want to share an article but don't feel like showing the unnecessarily long URL you can simply paste your URL into my app and receive the shorter (and cuter) URL back.
A user also has the option of providing the origin or description of the link, if they'd like. All URLs are saved and if you'd like to update the URL description you can do that at any given time. If you would no longer like to keep a link, simply delete it. If the URL list is getting a little too long you can clear the history and start fresh.
